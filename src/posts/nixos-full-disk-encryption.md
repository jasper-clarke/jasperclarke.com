Not long ago I had some super secure data on my server and I wanted it to survive just about anything from a network attack to a physical theft.
Now the NixOS documentation is a bit lacking on this topic, but I've found a few resources that helped me to get this working.
Here you go guys, finally a single guide with all the steps.

**Note**<br>
This guide does expect that you are in the minimal ISO and have connected to your network via Ethernet or `wpa_cli`.
If you want to know how to setup NixOS from the very beginning, check out my [NixOS Homelab Install Guide](/blog/nixos-homelab-the-install).

## Partitioning

**Note**<br>
In the following snippets I will refer to the drive we are encrypting as `/dev/sda` but yours might be `/dev/nvme0n1`.

If you haven't already, switch to the root user with `sudo -i`

```sh
# Open gdisk on the disk we're installing on
gdisk /dev/sda

# -----------------------
# BEGIN GDISK COMMANDS

# print the partitions on the disk
Command: p

# Delete a partition. Select the partition number when prompted.
# Repeat for all partitions.
Command: d

# Create the EFI boot partition
Command: n
Partition number: 1
First sector: <enter for default>
Last sector: +1G       # make a 1 gigabyte partition
Hex code or GUID: ef00 # this is the EFI System type

# Create the LVM partition
Command: n
Partition number: 2
First sector: <enter for default>
Last sector: <enter for default - rest of disk>
Hex code or GUID: 8e00 # Linux LVM type

# Write changes and quit
Command: w

# END GDISK COMMANDS
# ---------------------
```

If you want more of an explanation on what these commands are doing please look at the [Queensland FP Lab - Installing NixOS](https://qfpl.io/posts/installing-nixos/) post as it is really good!

## Formatting and Encryption

`$LVM_PARTITION` is `/dev/nvme0n1p2` or `/dev/sda2`, this is the second partition we just created.

```sh
# You will be asked to enter your passphrase - DO NOT FORGET THIS
cryptsetup luksFormat $LVM_PARTITION
```

If you want to decrypt the drive on boot without input you can write a decryption key to a USB or SD Card.
As an example if you only ever access this computer via SSH you will want the computer to be able to boot independantly without needing a password input.

Note this method will make the decryption drive unusuable for anything else.

```sh
# Create a random key
dd if=/dev/random of=hdd.key bs=4096 count=1
# Append the key to the list of secure keys that can unlock the drive.
cryptsetup luksAddKey $LVM_PARTITION ./hdd.key

# Now write the key to your USB or SD Card, find it from lsblk.
dd if=hdd.key of=/dev/REPLACE-HERE
```

Continue here.

```sh
# SKIP TO HERE IF NOT USING USB UNLOCKING.
# Decrypt the encrypted partition and call it nixos-enc. The decrypted partition
# will get mounted at /dev/mapper/nixos-enc
cryptsetup luksOpen $LVM_PARTITION nixos-enc
```

```sh
# Create the LVM physical volume using nixos-enc
pvcreate /dev/mapper/nixos-enc

# Create a volume group that will contain our root and swap partitions
vgcreate nixos-vg /dev/mapper/nixos-enc

# Create a swap partition that is 16G in size - the amount of RAM on this machine
# Volume is labeled "swap"'
lvcreate -L 16G -n swap nixos-vg

# Create a logical volume for our root filesystem from all remaining free space.
# Volume is labeled "root"
lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n root nixos-vg

# $BOOT_PARTITION is your first partition, so `/dev/nvme0n1p1` or `/dev/sda1`

# Create a FAT32 filesystem on our boot partition
mkfs.vfat -n boot $BOOT_PARTITION

# Create an ext4 filesystem for our root partition
mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/nixos-vg/root

# Tell our swap partition to be a swap
mkswap -L swap /dev/nixos-vg/swap

# Turn the swap on before install
swapon /dev/nixos-vg/swap
```

Now let's mount the file system.

```sh
mount /dev/nixos-vg/root /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
# $BOOT_PARTITION is your first partition, so `/dev/nvme0n1p1` or `/dev/sda1`
mount $BOOT_PARTITION /mnt/boot
```

From here just generate a new configuration and replace the existing `boot` options with the following.

```nix
boot = {
  loader = {
    efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;
    grub = {
      enable = true;
      efiSupport = true;
      device = "nodev";
    };
  };
  initrd = {
    kernelModules = ["usb_storage"];
    luks.devices.cryptroot = {
      device = "/dev/second-partition-of-your-drive"; # [!code highlight]
      preLVM = true;

      # If using a USB or SD Card for decryption include the following.
      allowDiscards = true;
      keyFileSize = 4096;
      # This is the disk id of your USB or SD Card.
      # Get this by running `ls -l /dev/disk/by-id`,
      # and copy the long string into the spot below.
      keyFile = "/dev/disk/by-id/REPLACE-HERE"; # [!code highlight]

      # Use this if you want to fallback to the encryption password
      # when the drive can't be found. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!!
      fallbackToPassword = true;
    };
  };
};
```

Now just setup your configuration and run `nixos-install`

And that is it! Full Disk Encryption and remote unlocking with a flash drive.

This has been Jasper, until next time ðŸ‘‹
